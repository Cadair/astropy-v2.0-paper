\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
% first draft by Moritz (hamogu)
All astronomical research makes use of software in some way and
astronomy as a field has long supported the development of specialized
software tools for different astronomical tasks. Some of those
software packages are (or at least were) supported by large
institutions, e.g.\ IRAF \citep[developed at NOAO,][]{IRAF}, MIDAS
\citep[developed at ESO,][]{MIDAS}, or ds9 \citep[developed at
% * <bsipocz@gmail.com> 2017-09-28T21:05:00.569Z:
%
% > or ds9
% probably starlink is a better example as being a large package of software similarly to IRAF and MIDAS rather than a single tool.
%
% ^.
  SAO,][]{ds9}. These packages tend to address a wide range of users
and they typically provide some level of documentation and user
support. Other packages are developed foremost by individual research
groups and used mostly in work by members of this group. Those
packages can address more specialized needs, but are not necessarily
available to the community and even if they are, documentation can in
some cases be insufficient for new users and the quality of the
software, i.e. the robustness and the level of testing that has been
performed to ensure correctness, is not always clear. On the other
hand, there are also many widely used, well documented, high quality
software packages which are developed by individuals or small groups.

The implementation of astronomical software, be it for a package meant
for wide distribution or scripts and programs for a specific research
project, can be eased by the use of a library that provides core
functionality that is common to many astronomical tasks. Reading and
writing fits files is one example where it is time
consuming to implement the fits standard correctly and
programming is much faster when using an existing library perform this
task. Another example of such a common task is dealing with different
astronomical coordinate systems. The \astropy\ project aims to provide a
library of core astronomical functionality in the \python\ programming
language.

\python\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/}} is an increasingly popular
general-purpose scripting language that is available under a permissive open
source software licence free of charge for all major operating systems. Stable
and well-developed packages provide support for array arithmetic
\citep[\package{numpy},][]{numpy}, a wide variety of functions for scientific
computing \citep[\package{scipy},][]{numpy}, and publication-quality plotting
\citep[\package{matplotlib},][]{matplotlib}. Tens of thousands of other packages
are available which can help with tasks that are not astronomy specific but
might be performed in the course of astronomical research, e.g., presenting
results on websites or interfacing with databases.

At the same time, an ecosystem of tools, programs, and webservices
has become available that makes it easier to collaborate on code development,
continuously test the code, build and provide documentation, and
supply downloadable packages. The \astropy\ project aims to develop and
provide high quality code and documentation according to the best
practices in software development. The project makes use of these
tools to do so without central institutional oversight.

The first public release of the \astropy\ package is described in
\cite{astropy}. Since then, the \astropy\ package has been
used in hundreds of projects, and the scope of the package as grown
considerably. At the same time, the community of astronomers
contributing to the project has grown tremendously and an ecosystem
of packages supporting or affiliated with the \astropy\ core has
developed. In this paper, we describe the current status of the
\astropy\ community, the \astropy\ core package, and the \astropy\
ecosystem.

We start by describing the way the \astropy\ project works and is
organized in \sectionname~\ref{sec:concepts}.  The project develops a core
package called \astropypkg\ (\sectionname~\ref{sec:core}) and several
separate packages that help setting up the infrastructure for testing,
documentation etc.\ (\sectionname~\ref{sec:infrastructure}). In
\sectionname~\ref{sec:learning} we give an overview of the wealth of
resources created to teach new users the use of the \astropy\ packages
and how to contribute to the community. We end with a short vision for
the future of \astropy\ in \sectionname~\ref{sec:future}.

{\bf Very rough first text!}

Historically, it has been unusual to keep units as part of numbers, especially as speed was often deemed essential and quantities used to be slower than regular arrays. Hence, programs and functions expected to be fed parameters in particular units, as (hopefully) stated in their documentation.  In \astropypkg\ 0.4, therefore, unit and quantity support was still somewhat spotty, but this has changed greatly.  One of the riskiest classes was ngles, where both degrees and radians were ``obvious'' default units to some. As a consequence, quantities are most fully integrated in the coordinates module (\sectionname~\ref{sec:coordinates}). In \astropypkg\ 2.0, one can also opt in to use quantities fully in tables, by using the {\tt QTable} class (see \sectionname~\ref{sec:table}). As a result, units in fits tables are also well-supported. For most other modules, quantities are at least accepted, and often assumed by default.

In the process, some standard wrappers have been defined that make defining functions that require quantities as input simpler. As an extension of this, we plan to define wrappers for functions that work on numbers that will automatically convert quantities to any required units.

\subsection{Release cycle and Long Term Support}
% This could also include information about the development cycle
% Brigitta can writes this up if there's no other taker
%
% - reference APE2 for versioning and APE10 for dropping python2 support
% - shall we maybe refer to the release calendar, too?
% - should we mention that v3.0 is the exception to the version numbering
%   scheme we use by not being 2.1?
\par The general scheme for the releases and version numbering that the core
package has adopted if the following. \astropypkg\ has new feature releases every
6 months, and between feature releases additional bugfix releases that
contain only bugfixes but no new features. The timing of
%
\par Long-term support (LTS) releases continue to receive bugfixes for 2
years with no changes to the API. They are ideal for pipelines and other
applications where API stability is essential. The latest LTS release is
also the last one that supports \python 2, and will receive bug fixes until the
end of 2019.
%
\par The version numbering of \astropypkg\ reflects on the release scheme
described above. The core package uses the form x.y.z, where x is advances
on LTS, y is advanced for a non-LTS feature release, and z is advanced on
bugfix releases.

\section{Astropy Core Package v2.0}
\label{sec:core}
The \astropy\ project aims to provide \python-based packages for all tasks that are commonly needed in a large subset of the astronomical community. Two aspects of this (time and coordinate transformations) are already discussed in great detail in section 3. In this section, we highlight other features introduced or substantially improved since version v0.2, which is described in \citet{astropy}.

\subsubsection{Overview}
The \texttt{astropy.coordinates} subpackage is designed to support representing
and transforming celestial coordinates and, new in version 2.0, velocities.
The framework heavily relies on the \texttt{astropy.units} subpackage, and most
inputs to objects in this subpackage are expected to be \texttt{Quantity}
objects.
A key concept behind the design of this subpackage is that coordinate
\textit{representations} and \textit{reference systems / frames} are independent
of one another.
For example, a set of coordinates in the International Celestial Reference
System (ICRS) reference frame could be represented as a spherical (distance,
right ascension, declination) or Cartesian coordinates.
They can therefore be re-represented or transformed to other reference frames
(e.g., the Galactic frame) in an independent way.

The classes that handle coordinate representations (the \texttt{Representation}
classes) act like three-dimensional vectors and thus support vector arithmetic.
The classes that represent reference systems and frames (the \texttt{Frame}
classes) internally use \texttt{Representation} objects to store the coordinate
data---that is, the \texttt{Frame} classes accept coordinate data, either as a
specified \texttt{Representation} object, or using short-hand keyword arguments
to specify the components of the coordinates.
These preferred representation and short-hand component names differ between
various astronomical reference systems.
For example, in the ICRS frame, longitude and latitude are right ascension
(\texttt{ra}) and declination (\texttt{dec}), whereas in the Galactic frame, the
spherical angles are Galactic longitude (\texttt{l}) and latitude (\texttt{b}).
Each of the \texttt{Frame} classes define their own component names and
preferred \texttt{Representation} class.
The frame-specific component names map to corresponding components on the
underlying \texttt{Representation} object that internally stores the coordinate
data.
For most frames the preferred representation is spherical.

Many of the \texttt{Frame} classes also have attributes specific to the
corresponding reference system that allow the user to specify the frame.
For example, the Fifth Fundamental Catalogue (FK5) reference system requires
specifying an equinox to determine the reference frame.
If required, these additional frame attributes must be specified along with the
coordinate data when a \texttt{Frame} object is created.

The typical user doesn't usually have to interact with the \texttt{Frame} or
\texttt{Representation} classes directly.
Instead, \texttt{astropy.coordinates} provides a high-level interface to
representing astronomical coordinates through the \texttt{SkyCoord} class.
The \texttt{SkyCoord} class was designed to provide a single, go-to class that
accepts a wide range of possible inputs, and supports coordinate data in any
reference frame with a corresponding \texttt{Frame} class in any representation
with a corresponding \texttt{Representation} class.

\subsubsection{Key new features}

\begin{description}\itemsep0ex
    \item[Local Earth coordinate frames] In addition to representing celestial
    coordinates, \astropypkg\ now supports specifying positions on the Earth in
    a number of different geocentric systems with the \texttt{EarthLocation}
    class.
    With this, \astropypkg\ now supports Earth-location-specific coordinate
    systems such as the altitude-azimuth (\texttt{AltAz}) or horizontal system.
    Transformations between \texttt{AltAz} and any Barycentric coordinate frame
    also requires specifying a time using the \texttt{Time} class from
    \texttt{astropy.time}.
    With this new functionality, many of the common tasks associated with
    observation planning can now be completed with \astropypkg\ or the
    \astropy-affiliated package \texttt{astroplan} (TODO: cite zenodo entry?).

    \item[Proper motion and velocity transformations]
    In addition to positional coordinate data, the \texttt{Frame} classes now
    also support velocity data.
    As the default representation for most frames is spherical, most of the
    \texttt{Frame} classes expect proper motion and radial velocity components
    to specify the velocity information.
    The names of the proper motion components all start with \texttt{pm} and
    adopt the same longitude and latitude names as the positional components.
    Transforming coordinates with velocity data is also supported, but in some
    cases the transformed velocity components have limited accuracy because the
    transformations are done numerically.
    The visualization of the coordinate frame transform graph highlights which
    velocity transformations can be done exactly and which transformations are
    done using a finite-difference scheme.
    The low-level interface for specifying and transforming velocity data (see
    the next point) is currently experimental.
    As such, in v2.0, only the \texttt{Frame} classes (and not the
    \texttt{SkyCoord} class) support handling velocities.

    \item[Derivatives of coordinate representations]
    As mentioned above, the \texttt{Representation} classes act like
    three-dimensional vectors.
    \texttt{astropy.coordinates} now also supports handling first derivatives of
    vectors / representations through the new \texttt{Differential} classes.
    The \texttt{Differential} classes are currently used internally within the
    \texttt{Frame} classes to store the velocity data.

    \item[JPL ephemeris]
    TODO: JPL ephemerids % Erik?

Q: does it make sense to refer forward to fits support, even though it is 3.0?

\subsection{Data arrays}

\subsubsection{NDDdata}
% Matt C., Michael, or Steve C.
% Larry (nddata.utils)
%NOTE (Larry), The package is nddata, which includes the NDData object.  %Don't forget the nddata.utils functionality (e.g. Cutout2D, block\_reduce, %etc.).

\subsubsection{Tables}
\label{sec:table}

\subsubsection{Unified file read/write interface}

Check when it was added (0.3?). Overview of the supported formats (ascii, fits, votable).

\subsubsection{Enhanced CSV format}

\subsubsection{ASCII, FITS, etc.}

One subsection per format (if enough new features) ?

\begin{itemize}
\item ascii : fast reader/writer (1.0), HTML tables
\item fits: lazy loading, command-line scripts (fitsheader, fitsinfo)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modeling}
\label{sec:modeling}
% Nadia
% Lim blackbody
% Tom R. -- unit support
The whole modeling submodule was missing from the previous paper, so everything really, including compound models, unit support etc.

\subsection{Convolution}
% Adam G.

\astropypkg\ implements `normalized convolution' \citep[e.g.,][]{Knutsson1993}, which is an image reconstruction technique in which missing data are ignored during the convolution and replaced with values interpolated using the kernel.   In version $<=1.3$, the direct convolution and fft convolution approaches were not consistent, with fft convolution implementing normalized convolution and direct convolution implementing a different approach.  As of v2.0, the two methods are consistent and include a suite of consistency checks.


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{convolution_example.png}
An example showing different modes of convolution available in the \python\ ecosystem.  The red x's mark pixels that are set to NaN in the original data (a).  If the data are convolved with a Gaussian kernel on a 9x9 grid using scipy's direct convolution (b), any pixel within range of the original NaN pixels is also set to NaN.  Panel (c) shows what happens if the NaNs are set to zero first: the originally NaN regions are depressed relative to their surroundings.  Finally, panel (d) shows \astropypkg's convolution behavior, where the missing pixels are replaced with values interpolated from their surroundings using the convolution kernel.
\end{figure}

\section{Infrastructure for affiliated packages}
\label{sec:infrastructure}
% - should we use links to the appropriate github repo?
%
\par In addition to astronomy related packages and libraries, the \astropy\
Project also contains and supports several infrastructure package that are
very generic. The following sections describes the most widely used
selection of them.
%
\subsubsection{Package template}
% Brigitta may write this up if there is no other takers
\par \astropy\ provides a template package that any \python\ package is welcome to
use (many affiliated packages do so). The template contains a ready-to-go
package layout. It provides infrastructure such as documentation tools,
testing framework and CI templates and configurations, Cython integration,
and documentation on how to make it all work.
%
\subsection{Continuous integration helpers}
% Brigitta
\texttt{ci-helpers} is a collection of scripts that empowers package
maintainers to control their testing set up and installation process for
various continuous integration services via a set of environment
variables. While the current development is mostly driven by the needs of
the \astropy\ ecosystem, the actual usage of this package is extremely
widespread. Currently we support setups for TravisCI and AppveyorCI.
